# hello-world
First project on github i guess

I'm supposed to write sth about me here.

I'm currently working in the medical field but I'm becoming fed up with both the bad pay (which i expected and accepted) AND the ungratefulness of the patients (which i definitely did not accept. This was supposed to balance out the bad pay).
So now I'll try and get into coding which i used to love back in school. Right now I'm at the GitHub Part of the Computer Science Course on Codecademy (24% completed, yay)
